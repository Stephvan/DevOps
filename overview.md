1. Create a Value Stream Map (VSM):

Creating a value stream map, or VSM, helps you analyze your current release cycle process.
The purpose of a VSM is to visually show where in the process a team creates value and where there's waste.
The goal, of course, is to arrive at a process that delivers maximum value to the customer with minimum waste.
A VSM can help you pinpoint those areas that either don't contribute any value or that actually reduce the value of the product.

VSM will help you get a sense of where a team fits into the DevOps model. tHis helps to pinpoint area where there is waste and how to minimize those wate time and improve efficiency. 
Working towards a more efficient process without disrupting what you currently have in place is the principle of DevOps.

DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our customers.

DevOps is a practice.

By practices, we mean:

Agile planning. Together, we'll create a backlog of work that everyone on the team and in management can see.
We'll prioritize the items so we know what we need to work on first.
The backlog can include user stories, bugs, and any other information that helps us.


Continuous integration (CI). We'll automate how we build and test our code.
We'll run that every time a team member commits changes to version control.


Continuous delivery (CD). CD is how we test, configure, and deploy from a build to a QA or production environment.


Monitoring. We'll use telemetry to get information about an applicationâ€™s performance and usage patterns.
We can use that information to improve as we iterate.
